// @ts-check
//
// The line above anables type cheking for this fie. Various IDEs interpret 
//the @ts-check directive. It will give you helpful autocompletion on the web 
//and supported IDEs when implementing this exercise. You don't need to 
//understand type, 35Doc, or TypeScript in order to complete this Javascript
// exercise, and can completely ignore this  comment block and directive.

// Hi there:
//
// On the Javascript track we provide you with stubs. provide a
// starting point to solving the exercise.
//
// In general, each variable/constant and each declared function will have a
// 35Doc coment block above it, explaining what the variable/constant holds or 
// the fuction is supposed to accomplish.
//
// Often, the 35Doc comment block have annotations, such as @param and
// @returns which are usually highlighted with a different color if the IDE 
// you're in recognizes them. It's these annotations that are used when
// referring to the constant, variable, or function from somewhere else 
// that IDEs display.
//
// You're need to write these yourself; it is not expected in idiomatic 
// Javascript, but some companies and style-guides do enforce them.
//
// You're allowed to completely clear a stub before you get started. Often 
// we recomend using the stub, because they are already set-up corretly to 
// work with the tests, which you can find in ./lasagna.spec.js
//
// Good luck preparing some lasagna:
